<p>hikari3 is a site I started in May 2023. Initially using LynxChan, we recently switched to our own board software developed in-house after the site turned 2 years old.</p>

# What is hikari3.ch?

hikari3.ch is an Japanese inspired anonymous image board, similar to sites like Futaba Channel, 4chan, and its many derivitives.
hikari3.ch was founded in May of 2023 by syrno and continues to run via mom's credit cards.
The primary focus at hikari3 is discussion surrounding chinese cartoons (anime), manga, video games, technology, etc. but these aren't the only topics discussed on the site.

<br>

The site kinda started in early May 2023, but it was just me and my friends messing around and shitposting, so the official date of when the site started is May 21st, 2023, when I shared it on Heyuri (although it was actually the 20th for me, but 21st for most parts of the world so I just say 21).

After this, the site slowly spread across other boards.
