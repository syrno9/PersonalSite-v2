Hello, my name is Travis. I'm an almost 19 year old college student studying computer science in California. After playing on my brother's modded PSP with a bunch of emulators and ROMs in 2011 when I was 5, I started becoming more interested in technology. When I was 11, I tried making NES ROM hacks using programs other people made, after that, I wanted to learn to code my own stuff.

<p>When I was 16/almost 17, I started <a href="/projects/hikari3">hikari3.ch</a> (yes, underage b&), through which I learned a lot more about system administration and the web in general.</p>
<p>This was the first time I've ever actually operated a site on the web, and while I don't really want to go into web development as a career, I think the experience I got from it was valueable, and very fun.</p>
<br>
<p>After a bit, I became motivated to actually make a personal site, so I made this site sometime in March-April 2024 I think.</p>
<p>Basically, what this site is going to be used for is me dumping random bits of information I find interesting.</p>
