title: "Stuff I Use"

How I do my computing. If you wanna go straight to the point: See section [TLDR](#tldr)

# My computer
My main computer is a Thinkpad x220, which runs Arch Linux. I also have a T60 and T420s which I used to use regularly. My x220 has an Intel Core i5-2520M with 8GB of RAM.

# The software I use

### Operating System
My choice of operating systems has flip flopped over the years. Of course, I grew up with Windows, and I still use it regularly (although not as often as before), but I got into GNU/Linux when I was 15. The first one I used was Mint, then I got into using Arch shortly after. When I was 17, I installed Gentoo on the crappy Toshiba laptop I was using at the time so I can flex on my friend ([Fish](https://i-am.fish)) who just recently installed Arch. When I was using my T60 for college, I had Artix with OpenRC installed on it, but after getting my T420s, I ended up just going back to Arch instead. I didn't use Gentoo that much cause I hated compiling everything, and stuff on Arch feels like it Just Werks.

### Environment
For my first couple years of using Arch, I either just stuck with using Trinity DE cause I liked the look of it, or XFCE since it's pretty light. After installing Gentoo, I ended up using dwm instead of a DE. This was the first time I've ever used a tiling window manager and I really enjoyed how simple it was. Along with that, I used st as my terminal, and I generally just started using terminal based programs more since I found them to be way more convenient. This is the stuff I've been using since then.

### Browser
The first browser I ever used as a kid was Firefox 3 I think (cause that's what my dad had installed on the computer), but I was just using Google Chrome by the time I was 10 like most people. After getting into GNU/Linux, I started using Firefox again since it seemed like that was everyone's goto browser. Since then, I haven't really used anything else, but I did use Brave for a bit, but I'm just too used to Firefox based stuff now instead. In mid-late 2024, I switched to Librewolf after seeing good things about it on hikari3.ch/t/. It's pretty much just Firefox but without dumb Mozilla stuff.

I don't have a bannana to compare it with.
