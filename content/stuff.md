# My computer
The computer I've been daily driving is a Thinkpad T420s I got from my friend recently, but I also have a desktop running Tiny 10 I've had since middle school for muh vidya. I don't really know much about it other than that its an ASUS computer with an AMD GPU, and it has good enough specs to play TF2. Before my T420s, I had a T60 that I was using as my laptop for school only, but in the end it was really slow and a lot of programs I wanted to use weren't supported on it, even as I upgraded it.

My T60 and T420s  

The CPU on my T420s is an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M. It has an integrated GPU with 8GB of RAM. I plan to upgrade it eventually, but this has been working very well for me.

Some of the only things I liked better about the T60 is the keyboard (it's only slightly better) and having that 4:3 display was really nice.

# The software I use

### Operating System
My choice of operating systems has flip flopped over the years. Of course, I grew up with Windows, and I still use it regularly (although not as often as before), but I got into Linux when I was 15. The first one I used was Mint, then I got into using Arch shortly after. When I was 17, I installed Gentoo on the crappy Toshiba laptop I was using at the time so I can flex on my friend ([Fish](https://i-am.fish)) who just recently installed Arch. When I was using my T60 for college, I had Artix with OpenRC installed on it, but after getting my T420s, I ended up just going back to Arch instead. I didn't use Gentoo that much cause I hated compiling everything, and stuff on Arch feels like it Just Werks.

### Environment
For my first couple years of using Arch, I either just stuck with using Trinity DE cause I liked the look of it, or XFCE since it's pretty light. After installing Gentoo, I ended up using dwm instead of a DE. This was the first time I've ever used a tiling window manager and I really enjoyed how simple it was. Along with that, I used st as my terminal, and I generally just started using terminal based programs more since I found them to be way more convenient. This is the stuff I've been using since then.

### Browser
The first browser I ever used as a kid was Firefox 3 I think (cause that's what my dad had installed on the computer), but I was just using Google Chrome by the time I was 10 like most people. After getting into Linux, I started using Firefox again since it seemed like that was everyone's goto browser. Since then, I haven't really used anything else, but I did use Brave for a bit, but I'm just too used to Firefox based stuff now instead. In mid-late 2024, I switched to Librewolf after seeing good things about it on hikari3.ch/t/.
